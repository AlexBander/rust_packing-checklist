# Packing checklist

A simple web app to keep track of items to pack for a trip. The idea is to
create an individualized checklist for every trip based on a set of user-defined
templates.

Multiple users can use the app, with everyone having their own set of trips.

The app is UI-only - all the backend data is stored in Google Firebase Realtime
Database. Firebase is also responsible for user authentication.
